## Timonel OTA workflow ##
[This diagram](https://app.diagrams.net/#Hcasanovg%2Ftimonel-ota-demo%2Fmaster%2Fdiagrams%2FFirmware-Update.drawio) shows a series of steps made by an I2C ESP8266 master to update the firmware running on ATtiny85 slave.
It was produced with [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) [(draw.io)](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio), a very nice open-source diagramming tool.
